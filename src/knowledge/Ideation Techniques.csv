Ideation Techniques Name,Technique Description,Recommendations for GPTs,How many ideas to generate
Мозговой штурм,Brainstorming is a group technique in which participants freely propose ideas on a given topic without being criticized. It allows for an open atmosphere where each idea is valued and can be improved.,Try to create many ideas on a given topic without filtering them at the generation stage. Do not be afraid to propose unusual or even absurd variants.,10
Метод 635,"Method 635 involves 6 characters writing 3 ideas in 5 minutes each, then passing them on to the next participant. The aim is to build on the others' ideas by adding to or improving them.","Start by selecting six different sources of data or insights that may be useful for generating ideas. For example, market analysis, feedback from customers, industry trends, team ideas, technical innovations, and competitive analysis. Next, for each of the selected sources, generate three ideas. ",18
Морфологический анализ,Morphological analysis breaks down a problem into its components and explores possible variations of each part. This helps to create complex and out-of-the-box solutions.,"Break down a given topic into its constituent elements and characteristics, and then, using predefined criteria and parameters, generate ideas and options based on various combinations of these elements and characteristics",7
SCAMPER,"SCAMPER is a method that uses a checklist of questions to modify existing products or services. Includes the approaches: Replace, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Re-apply, Eliminate and Re-position.","Sequentially examine each of the seven aspects of this technique (replace, connect, adapt, modify, expose, exclude, and unfold) for a user-supplied topic. Generate ideas and options based on each of the aspects, applying them to the context of the task.",7
Метод Дельфи,The Delphi method is an anonymous survey in which experts answer questions independently. Their answers are analyzed and used to form a consensus.,Create 5 experts from a given problem domain. Write each expert's role and then 3 of their ideas. Then use an algorithm to aggregate their answers to identify the most promising ideas,15
Аннексия,"Annexation is based on the principle of extending or attaching new elements to existing objects, ideas or processes. The process involves identifying a basic element, investigating its properties, annexing new elements and evaluating capabilities. It allows you to extend the functionality of existing solutions, find new uses and create innovative solutions through the integration of different products and technologies.",Use a basic object or idea as a starting point. Then generate ideas about how it could be expanded or improved by adding new elements or features. Consider how these changes might create new value or solve existing problems.,7
Латеральное мышление,"Lateral thinking encourages you to look for unconventional and illogical approaches to problem solving, moving away from traditional logical methods.","Break away from traditional approaches and logic. Try generating ideas that seem unconventional or even illogical to open up new perspectives. Approach a given topic or problem from an unconventional and unfamiliar perspective by actively using associative thinking, analogies, and applying methods that may seem unexpected.",7
Шесть шляп мышления,"Six Thinking Hats asks participants to look at a problem from different perspectives by 'wearing' hats of different colors symbolizing different thinking styles (emotion, logic, optimism, etc.).","Use different 'hats' to look at the problem from different angles. For each 'hat', create ideas that match its perspective. White Hat (Information): Gather all available information about a given topic or problem. Research facts and data and then generate ideas based on that information.Red Hat (Emotion): Approach a topic from an emotional perspective. Consider what emotions and feelings might be associated with the task and generate ideas by considering the emotional aspects. Yellow Hat (Positive Aspects): Focus on the positive aspects of the task or topic. Consider possible benefits, advantages, and potential successes, which helps generate optimistic ideas. Black Hat (Negative Aspects): Consider the negative aspects and risks associated with the topic. Identify problems and possible limitations to generate ideas by considering these aspects and finding ways to address them. Green Hat (Creativity): Approach a task from a creative point of view. Generate out-of-the-box ideas using imagination and creative approaches, without limitations. Blue Hat (Process Management): Evaluate the idea generation process as a whole. Take into account logic, planning and control. Provide a structured and organized approach to idea generation.",6
Метод связей,The linkage method is about analyzing and changing attributes of an object or system to generate new ideas.,"Explore connections between different aspects and elements of a given topic or problem, paying attention to their interactions and dependencies. Generate ideas based on the identified connections and interrelationships to find non-obvious solutions and creative ideas in different areas.",7
TRIZ,TRIZ is a systematic approach to inventive problem solving based on the analysis of patents and technical solutions.,"Analyze a problem using TRIZ principles such as identifying contradictions, identifying standard solutions, and analyzing development trends. Generate ideas and solutions based on the application of these principles to find innovative ways to solve problems and overcome contradictions in different areas.",7
